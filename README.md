# Employee Tracker
## Description
Hello! This is my Employee Tracker project. I created it by using MySQL , Node.JS and Inquirer. First I created 2 Schemas called insert.sql and schema.sql. In those I created the database for all the data. Then I created a require.js file so that it can have a connection to my database. Finally I created a server.js. The purpose for the server.js is to get all the data. It works by giving a list of options like view employees , view roles, etc.
Then depending on the user's input, different data will be displayed. 
## Installations
You must install MySql, Node.js , and Inqurier.
